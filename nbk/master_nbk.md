Package plm's within estimator exactly reproduces the results published in Table 4.
The next step should be to assess model fit using the most informative 
formulation, i.e. Model 4. Note that the standard errors could be reproduced 
exactly as the text is somewhat vague on what robust standard errors were used.
Anyhow, the different versions supplied by plm did not lead to substantively
different conclusions.

Proposed EDA:
    1. Frequency and electoral success of PECs per country (over time)
    2. Jackknife: Do the results depend on particular countries?
    3. Increase precision: Replace PR/Plurality by District Magnitude
