# Introduction

- __99__ __RQ__ What impact do political institutions have on individual perceptions of representation and thus turnout.
- Assumptions: (1) voting = expressive, i.e. show support for _party_, (2) proximity voting, i.e. feeling of representation by one party = permissive condition for voting

# Theory

- __101__ Institutional context of individual turnout decisions: 
    (a) consensus democracy -> broadens opportunities for feeling represented, but: (i) consensus building & depoliticization of disagreements reduces feeling of representation, (ii) possibly boring campaigns with low mobilization
    (b) Electoral systems -> Powell's visions of democracy turn on electoral system, b/c PR increases range of political offers and thus policy congruence b/w voters and parties, __102__ Assumed mechanisms: 1. PR ->+ ENEP ->+ chance of close offer, 2. PR ->+ Programmatic diversity ->+ Polarization (easier to identify matching offer, differences b/w parties more salient during elections; __103__ turnout ~~ PR spurious once controlled for polarization & ENEP)

# Design & Results

- using pooled CSES individual, aggregate, and multilevel analysis of individual turnout ~ representation ~ institutional context
- individual level data reweighted to match country lvl turnout (overreporting bias)
- Findings:
    + Feeling of representation increases propensity to vote
    + PR conducive to feeling represented, but: partially mediated by party system polarization
    + Turnout ~~ PR declines drastically once controlling for polarization & perceptions of representation
    + Patterns of Democracy (consensus democracy indicators) not relevant
