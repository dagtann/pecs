Blais, AndrÃ© (2006): What affects voter turnout? In: Annual Review of Political Science, __9__, pp. 111-125.

## Pioneering Studies

- __111__ Powell 1982, APSR Powell 1986, APSR Jackman 1987
- Powell 1982/1986: nationally competitive districts increase turnout b/c parties & voters incentivized to participate
- Jackman 1987: nationally competitive districts, electoral disproportionality, multipartism, unicameralism, compulsory voting

## The Impact of Institutions

### Compulsory Voting

- __113__ estimated effect on average 10-15 per cent, ""Compulsory voting increases turnout" can be construed as a well-established proposition."
- implied questions: sanctions required? type & severity of sanctions required?
- summary: "[...], we know that compulsory voting increases turnout and that its impact depends on its enforcement. But we do not know how strict that enforcement must be in order to work.", -> microfoundations insufficiently established

### Electoral System

- __114__  mixed evidence on PR -> (1) PR boosts turnout except in Latin America, (2) no generalizable correlation b/w turnout & PR, microfoundations insufficiently clear

### Unicameralism

- __114__ argument: turnout higher when political power concentrated in single chamber b/c elections more decisive, generalization: "the same rationale shuld apply to the division of power between the president and the legislature, between the central government and subnational (or supranational) governments"
- mixed evidence, b/c __115__ poor summary measure of powerful institutions
- "The challenge is to come up with reliable scale that encompass the different dimensions of salience."

### Other Institutional Variables

- __115__ voting age: lower voting age depresses turnout b/c 
- vote-facilitating rules: e.g. absentee voting, number of polling days, accessibility of ballot box
- __116__ "The question is not whether voting facilities influence turnout but rather which ones matter most, and how great a difference they make."
- problem: endogeneity of election laws > "measure to facilitate the vote may be more likely to be adopted in countries where turnout is low or declining"

## The Socioeconomic Environment

- __117__ turout increases in economically advanced democracies, but: non-linear, main difference: poor ctries vs. rest
- implied question: does turnout change with economic downturns? ambivalence: mobilize grievances OR withdraw -> ambivalent effects == nil finding

## Party Systems and Electoral Outcomes

- __118__ __Party system format__ Intuition: turnout increases in number of political parties b/c (1) higher chance of party representing policy preferences, (2) greater mobilizational effort of parties, neg. csq: "The more parties there are, the greater the likelihood that the government will be made of a coalition of parties. In systems that have coalition governments, electoral outcomes are less decisive, because the final composition of the government depends on the deals that parties are willing (or unwilling) to make. The presence of many parties may mean that voters have little say in the actual selection of the government."
- critique: turns on measurement of decisiveness, not party system format
- empirical evidence: usually negative correlation, but: !support of weak government identifiability b/c result travels to single party governments
- __119__ implication: PR !fosters turnout via number of parties -> what other microfoundations?
- decisiveness: "It could also be argued that what really matters is clarity of choice, that is, voters need to know with relative certainty the coalitions that might be formed. If that is the presumed process, then clarity-of-choice indicators must be constructed."
- __Closeness of elections__: realiably supported: close elections boost turnout, but effect often very small
- critique: (1) Does closeness matter at the national or district level? (2) What does closeness/competitivity mean in PR systems? -> cross-system validity of P1-P2 questioned
