# CH. 2 Identifying Pre-electoral Coalitions

- __11__ observational problems: (1) not always listed in official results, (2) if listeted, not disaggregated into members, (3) not detailed in case-study research
- __12 Def.__ "A pre-electoral coalition is a collection of parties that do not compete independently in an election, either because they publicly agree to coordinate their campaigns, run joint candidates or joint lists, or enter government together following the election."
- __observational criteria__
    + publicly stated -> rules out "implicit coaltions", e.g. outgoing government coalitions
    + mmb parties do not compete truly independent, i.e. $\exists$ coordination
    + electoral coalition at the national -> rules out shifting alliances at lower level elections
- __17__ Types of PECs from hi to lo coordination
    + nomination agreements, i.e. PEC presents joint candidates, freq in France
    + Joint lists, parties agree on single list
    + __19__ Dual ballot instructions: party leaders recommend split votes, e.g. Leihstimmenkampagnen in Germany
    + Vote transfer instructions: STV systems, instructions on rank order of candidates, e.g. Australian "How-to-vote" cards
    + __20__ public commitment to govern together
- [__CRITIQUE__] joint lists, dual ballot, and vote transfer do not differ on coordination, but exploit different incentives of the electoral system!
