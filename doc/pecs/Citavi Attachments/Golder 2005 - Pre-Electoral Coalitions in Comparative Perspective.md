Golder, Sona N. (2005): Pre-Electoral Coalitions in Comparative Perspective:
    A Test of Existing Hypotheses. In: *Electoral Studies*, 24.

- **RQ** **1** "[W]hy do some parties coordinate their electoral strategies as part of pre-electoral coalition, while others choose to compete independently at election time?"

## Relevance of Pre-electoral Coalitions

1. **3** impact on government composition & policy b/c exploit coordination failure of competitors
2. **3** normative implications for majoritarian & representative visions of democracy --> PECs identify viable government coalitions and thereby increase transparency under proportional representation
3. **4** Frequency: b/w 1946 & 2002, PECs contested in numerous elections in advanced democracies

## Theories of Pre-Electoral Coalition Formation

### Dispropotionality & PECs

- **5** highly disproportionate electoral systems benefit larger parties and therefore create incentive to form PECs -> "exploit electoral economies of scale"
- **6** qualifications:
    + (a) disproportionality conditioned by number of political parties, e.g. no incentive to form PECs when 2 parties compete in highly disproportional electoral system
    + (b) Number of parties = f(disproportionality), i.e. parties merge/coalesce in anticipation of disproportionality -> Puzzle: "If the incentives to coalesce are so great in disproportional systems, then one should not actually observe pre-electoral coalitions in these countries, there simply will not be a sufficently large number of independent parties. It is only when there are 'surplus' or 'excess' parties that choose to retain their party identity in spite of the incentives to merge created by disproportional systems that one would expect to observe electoral coalitions."
- hypothesis: Pr(PEC) = f(disprop | N_eff)

## PECs as Signalling Devices

- variants of the argument:
    1. members can form an effective government
    2. identify future government: **8** benefits risk averse voters who prefer certainty over bargaining lottery
    3. increase voter decisiveness
-  **9** credibility of the signal: govts actually form if possible
-  critique: "case-specific and _ad hoc_" -> how2 evaluate cross-case?
-  __10__ hypothesis: Pr(PEC) = f(N_eff)

## Data and Model

- __11__ __DEF PEC__ "collection of parties that do not compete idependently in an election either because they publicly agree to coordinate their campaigns, run joint candidates or joint lists, or govern together following the election"
    a. coalition must be stated publicly
    b. members may not compete independently
- vague on form -> ranges from announcement to single joint candidates in district
- Model Probit on party dyads, DV: formed PEC? **13** avoids aggregation to election level, b/c loss of information on electoral significance, number of partis involved

## Results

- supports H1, rejects H2, uses weird random effects formulation: dyads clustered by election
