- __1026 RQ__ How does disproportionality affect polarization among policy motivated parties?
- __1027__ approach: formal model of Downsian political competititon, find unique equilibrium in which (a) polarization decreases in disproportionality, (b) increases in ENEP if measured as distance b/w most distant parties
- "electoral disproportionality acts as a centripetal force, thereby resulting in low levels of polarization"
- __1028 Y?__ "On one hand, as a party moves toward the center, it increases its vote share and, hence, its weight in the implemented policy. On the other hand, when the leftist (rightist) party becomes too moderate in comparison to its opponent, the implemented policy might end up too far to the right (left) if the extra seat share gained from this moderation is relatively small. As the disproportionality of the electoral system increases, proposing a moderate platform may be worthwhile since the incentives to obtain some extra votes are amplified. In highly disproportional systems, a small advantage in votes is
translated into a large advantage in parliamentary seats and hence, into a large asymmetry between the weights of the two parties in the implemented policy."

## Measures of Polarization

1. Distance b/w most distant parties (MDP)
2. Dalton Index: $\sqrt{\sum_j v_j(\frac{p_j-\bar{p}}{\text{Midpoint Ideology Position}})}$ where $\bar{p} \equiv E(p)$

- theoretical predictions coincide with MDP measurement, not robust to DI

## Empirical Results

- Measuring disproprtionality: Taagepera: $n = (\frac{log(V)}{log(S)})^{\frac{1}{M}}$
- identification strategy: country & year fixed effects in a balanced panel of 21 countries
- institutional controls: coalition habits, N cabinet parties & their interaction, degree of constitional constraints, years of consolidated democracy, ideological distance b/w previous and current government, govt. change
