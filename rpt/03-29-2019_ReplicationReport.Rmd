## Introduction

Tillman argues that pre-electoral coalition increase the identifiability of possible governments and thereby augment electoral decisiveness. In effect, turnout should increase whenever pre-electoral coalitions form. To support his claim, Tillman reports fixed-effects panel regressions which predict turnout from various specifications of the existence and strength of pre-electoral coalitions. In the following, I reanalyze his contribution from several angles. In doing so, I concentrate on Tillman’s primary predictors: the presence of a pre-electoral coalition and the voting percentage a pre-electoral coalition achieved. My brief assessment exposes major flaws in Tillman’s modeling strategy.

## Can the data support any causal effect at all?

Generally speaking, fixed-effects panel regression models estimate the causal effect of some treatment by comparing the outcome on the same observation unit at different points in time. Consequently, a certain amount of (co-)variation within the units is required to estimate any causal effect. The figure below shows how within-differences in turnout and PECs align for every country in the data, and it gives reason to doubt Tillman’s analysis.

```{r, execute_varianceDecomposition, fig.show = "hide"}
source(
    file.path(
        path_project, "src", "r", "replication",
        "05_varianceDecomposition_ReponseVsTreatment.R"
    )
)
```

1. The correlation between turnout and PECs varies substantially across countries,
    ranging from indirect (e.g. Italy and New Zealand) to null (e.g. Denmark and
    Japan) to direct (e.g., Germany and Greece). It should thus be questioned how 
    representative of the data Tillman’s reported mean effect is.
2. On many occasions the correlation depends on outliers. For instance, the figure
    implies a direct association between the formation of PECs and turnout in the
    UK. However, the implication turns entirely on the 1983 and 1987 elections.
    Likewise, a strong association between turnout and the result for PECs is
    implied for Portugal. Again, the implication depends entirely on just two
    elections: 1979 and 1980.
3. Not all countries contribute equally Tillman’s results. Frist, pre-electoral
    coalitions formed in every French and Israelian election. In other words, the
    treatment is constant and these countries drop out of the analysis. Moreover,
    the association between treatment and response is weak or non-existent in
    almost half of all countries. Hence, Tillman’s results may be driven by strong
    positive outliers such as Greece respectively Portugal. Jackknife resampling
    supports that impression, even though it does not invalidate Tillman’s
    conclusions.

```{r, execute_jackknife}
source(file.path(path_project, "src", "r", "replication", "06_jacknife_fe.R"))

## The effect of PECs is spurious

Fixed effects analyses should routinely safeguard against mistaking such trends
in the outcome for treatment effects. More precisely, turnout has been declining
for decades in practically every established democracy. Despite that well known
fact, Tillman does not include time dummies in his analysis. Yet, as can be seen
from Models 2 and 5 in Table 1 the association between PECs and turnout becomes
indistinguishable from zero once year fixed-effects are included.

Moreover, treatment effects may vary over time. In other words, the return
from PECs to turnout may change over the observation period. Models 3 and 6 in the
table follow up on this possibility and interact the treatment with the year
fixed-effects. However, since the interaction terms are collectively
indistinguishable from 0, the statistical evidence does not support changing
returns from PECs.
